# W14D1 After-Class Assignment: Advanced sorting algorithms and coding challenges

## Approach: For this assignment I chose the `Merge Sort` algorithm because it is simple to use. `Merge Sort` has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` in the average and worst case scenarios.

## Algorithm: `Merge Sort` works by recursively dividing the input array into halves until each sublist contains only one element (a single-element list is considered sorted). Then, it merges the sorted sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining, which is the sorted array.

## Optimizations: This implementation is optimized because it uses the divide-and-conquer approach, which allows sorting to be done efficiently without excess memory usage. Also optimization is enhanced by sorting the array in place.
